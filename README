System requirements
-------------------

JDK   6   - http://java.sun.com/
Maven 3.0 - http://maven.apache.org/
Mojo  1.0 - http://github.com/dmenounos/mojo



Installing
----------

Create and populate the basic database schema. See:
memo-common/src/db

With the prerequisites in place, execute from the console:
mvn clean install



Developing with Eclipse
-----------------------

1. Create the basic projects with Maven:
   mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse

2. Import them into Eclipse:
   File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace

3. Convert "memo-portal" to a dynamic web project:

   1. From the "Properties" dialog and "Project Facets" panel,
      check the "Dynamic Web Module" and "Java" facets.

   2. Change the facet version to 2.5, i.e. Java EE 5.

   3. Uncheck the default option that creates a "web.xml" file.

   4. Change the default "WebContent" directory to "war".


The above forms the typical procedure for classic java web projects.
To work with GWT development mode, the following are also necessary.

4. Open the "Deployment Assembly" panel, in the "Properties" dialog.
   Normally the following entries should be present by default:

   /war                                            /
   /src/main/java                                  WEB-INF/classes
   /src/main/resources                             WEB-INF/classes

   1. Map the, maven resolved, jar dependencies:
   /out/memo-portal-1.0-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/lib       WEB-INF/lib

   2. Map the, GWT generated, javascript code:
   /out/memo-portal-1.0-SNAPSHOT/gwt               gwt

5. Open the "External Tool Configurations" and create one as such:

   Location:            <YOUR_MAVEN_INSTALL_PATH>/bin/mvn
   Working Directory:   ${workspace_loc:/memo-portal}
   Arguments:           antrun:run

6. Open the "Debug Configurations" and create one as such:

   Project: memo-portal


Finally the following describe the different run and debug options:

*) By starting the configuration #5, you will be able to dynamically change
   GWT client code, i.e. java classes

*) By starting the configuration #6, you will be able to dynamically debug
   GWT client code, i.e. java classes.
